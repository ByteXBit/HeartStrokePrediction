# HeartStrokePrediction
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict the likelihood of a stroke based on various health factors using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models.  
We performed detailed **data cleaning**, **visualization**, **feature engineering**, **model building**, and **evaluation**.  
This was done as part of an academic project to understand end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines and Deep Learning modeling.

## 1. Data Preprocessing

### Loading and Exploring Data
- The dataset `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv` was loaded using **pandas**.
- Basic information such as **shape** and **statistical description** was obtained to understand the dataset.

```python
data.shape
data.describe()
```

---

### Handling Missing Values
- The `bmi` column had missing values.
- Missing `bmi` values were filled with the **mean** value of BMI, grouped by **gender**, **marital status**, and **age group** to ensure contextual relevance.
- The `id` column was dropped as it does not provide any predictive value.

---

### Feature Engineering
- An `age_group` column was created to categorize individuals as Infant, Child, Adolescent, Young Adult, Adult, or Old Aged based on their age.
- Rows with ambiguous gender ("Other") were removed to maintain binary classification.

---

## 2. Data Visualization and Analysis

We used **Plotly Express**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** to visualize various feature relationships with `stroke`:

- **Gender vs Stroke** (Bar plot)

These visualizations helped understand which features were more influential.

## 3. Handling Class Imbalance

The dataset was highly imbalanced (very few people had strokes).

We used **upsampling** and **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance the dataset:

- Upsampling involved duplicating minority class samples.
- SMOTE generated synthetic samples to balance the classes.

---

## 4. Data Scaling

- Important continuous features like `age`, `avg_glucose_level`, and `bmi` were normalized using **MinMaxScaler** or **StandardScaler** for consistent scaling across ML models.

---

## 5. Machine Learning Models

We implemented and trained several ML models:

| Model | Key Details |
|------|-------------|
| **Extra Trees Classifier** | Ensemble method |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | Ensemble method, tuned with hyperparameters |
| **XGBoost Classifier** | Advanced boosting technique |
| **Gradient Boosting Classifier** | Boosted ensemble method |

Each model was:
- Trained on the training set.
- Evaluated on both training and testing sets.
- Assessed using **Accuracy Scores**, **Classification Reports**, and **Confusion Matrices**.

Example model training:

```python
etc_model = ExtraTreesClassifier()
rfc_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=29, max_leaf_nodes=900, max_features=0.8, criterion='entropy')
xgb_model = XGBClassifier(objective="binary:logistic", eval_metric="auc")
gbc_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(max_depth=29, min_samples_leaf=4, min_samples_split=13, subsample=0.8)

models = [etc_model, rfc_model, xgb_model, gbc_model]

for model in models:
    model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

Confusion matrices were plotted for each model.

## 6. Deep Learning Models (ANN)

To enhance prediction accuracy, Deep Learning models were built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

### Basic Neural Network
- A simple ANN model with two hidden layers.
- Compiled with `adam` optimizer and `binary_crossentropy` loss.
- Trained for 50 epochs.

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(16, input_dim=X.shape[1], activation='relu'),
    Dense(8, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

---

### Improved Neural Network
- Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE**.
- Added **Dropout layers** to prevent overfitting.
- Used **EarlyStopping** callback to terminate training early if no improvement was observed.

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(32, activation='relu', input_dim=X_train.shape[1]),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, restore_best_weights=True)
```

This improved model showed better generalization and achieved higher accuracy.

---

## 7. Evaluation

- **Classification reports** showed **precision**, **recall**, **f1-score** for both classes (Stroke / No Stroke).
- **Confusion matrices** visualized True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.
- **Test Accuracy** was printed at the end for both ML and DL models.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Through this project, we learned how to:

- Preprocess messy real-world healthcare datasets.
- Handle missing values thoughtfully.
- Balance imbalanced datasets using resampling and SMOTE.
- Build, train, and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Build deep learning models using Keras and TensorFlow.
- Evaluate models using statistical and visual metrics.

This end-to-end project helped us understand the critical steps in building a reliable prediction system for sensitive applications like healthcare.
